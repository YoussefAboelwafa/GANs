# ***Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)***

A GAN consists of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process:

- **Generator:** The Generator network takes random noise or some other form of input and attempts to generate data that resembles the real data itâ€™s been trained on. Over time, through the learning process, it becomes increasingly proficient at creating convincing fake data
- **Discriminator:** The Discriminator network, on the other hand, is tasked with distinguishing between real data and data produced by the Generator. It learns to differentiate genuine data from the synthetic data generated by the Generator.

The key concept in GANs is adversarial training. The Generator tries to improve its ability to produce realistic data, while the Discriminator strives to get better at distinguishing real from fake data. This adversarial process continues iteratively until the Generator generates data that is difficult for the Discriminator to distinguish from real data. At this point, the Generator has effectively learned to generate highly convincing and realistic synthetic data.
